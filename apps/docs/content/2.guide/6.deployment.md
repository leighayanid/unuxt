UNuxt is Docker-ready and can be deployed to any platform that supports Node.js or containers.

## Deploy with Docker

Use the included Docker configuration for production deployment.

### Build and run

```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop services
docker-compose down
```

### Configure production environment

Create a production `.env` file with secure values:

```bash [.env.production]
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@db:5432/unuxt
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your-secure-secret-min-32-chars
BETTER_AUTH_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

## Deploy manually

Build and run without Docker.

### Build the application

```bash
# Build all packages and apps
pnpm build
```

### Start the production server

```bash
# Start the web app
node apps/web/.output/server/index.mjs
```

## Deploy to Vercel

1. Connect your repository to Vercel
2. Set the root directory to `apps/web`
3. Configure environment variables in the Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy

```bash [vercel.json]
{
  "buildCommand": "cd ../.. && pnpm build",
  "outputDirectory": ".output"
}
```

## Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

1. Connect your repository to Cloudflare Pages
2. Set the build command:

```bash
pnpm build
```

3. Set the output directory:

```
apps/web/.output/public
```

4. Add environment variables in the Cloudflare dashboard

## Deploy to Netlify

1. Connect your repository to Netlify
2. Configure build settings:

```toml [netlify.toml]
[build]
  command = "pnpm build"
  publish = "apps/web/.output/public"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "20"
```

## Configure the database

For production, use a managed PostgreSQL service:

- [Neon](https://neon.tech) - Serverless Postgres
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com) - Postgres with extras
- [Railway](https://railway.app) - Simple deployment
- [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com) - MySQL alternative

Update your `DATABASE_URL` with the production connection string.

## Set up SSL

Ensure your production environment uses HTTPS. Most platforms handle this automatically, but for self-hosted deployments:

```nginx [nginx.conf]
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

## Monitor your application

Add monitoring for production visibility:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  // Add error tracking
  runtimeConfig: {
    public: {
      sentryDsn: process.env.SENTRY_DSN
    }
  }
})
```
